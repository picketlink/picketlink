      <title>What is PicketLink?</title>
      
      <para>
        PicketLink is an Application Security Framework for Java EE applications.  It provides features for authenticating users,
        authorizing access to the business methods of your application, managing your application's users, groups, roles and
        permissions, plus much more.  The following diagram presents a high level overview of the PicketLink modules.

        <title>Base module</title>
        
        <para>
          The base module provides the integration framework required to use PicketLink within a Java EE application.  
          It defines a flexible authentication API that allows pluggable authentication mechanisms to be easy configured,
          with a sensible default authentication policy that delegates to the identity management subsystem. It provides
          session-scoped authentication tracking for web applications and other session-capable clients, plus a
          customisable permissions SPI that supports a flexible range of authorization mechanisms for object-level security.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The base module libraries are as follows:

            <para>

      <section>
        <title>Identity Management</title>
        
        <para>
          The Identity Management module defines the base identity model; a collection of interfaces and classes
          that represent the identity constructs (such as users, groups and roles) used throughout PicketLink (see
          the Identity Management chapter for more details).  As such, it is a required module and must always be 
          included in any application deployments that use PicketLink for security. It also provides a uniform API 
          for managing the identity objects within your application. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Libraries are as follows:

            <para>
              <literal>picketlink-idm-api</literal> - PicketLink's Identity Management (IDM) API.  This library defines the 
              Identity Model central to all of PicketLink, and all of the identity management-related interfaces.

        <title>Federation</title>
        
        <para>
          The Federation module is an optional module that implements a number of Federated Identity standards, 
          such as SAML (both version 1.1 and 2.0), WS-Trust and OpenID.

      <title>License</title>
      
      <para>
        PicketLink 3.0 is licensed under the Apache License Version 2, the terms and conditions of which can be found at
        <ulink url="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">apache.org</ulink>.

      <title>Maven Dependencies</title>
      
      <para>
        The PicketLink libraries are available from the Maven Central Repository.  To use PicketLink in your Maven-based
        project, it is recommended that you first define a version property for PicketLink in your project's 
        <literal>pom.xml</literal> file like so:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<properties>
  <picketlink.version>]]>&project.version;<![CDATA[</picketlink.version>
</properties>]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        For a typical application, it is suggested that you include the following PicketLink dependencies:
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<dependencies>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.picketlink</groupId>
      <artifactId>picketlink-api</artifactId>
      <scope>compile</scope>
      <version>${picketlink.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.picketlink</groupId>
      <artifactId>picketlink-impl</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
      <version>${picketlink.version}</version>
  </dependency>]]></programlisting>
  
      <para>
        The identity management library is a required dependency of the base module and so will be automatically included.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you wish to use PicketLink's Identity Management features and want to include the default database schema
        (see the Identity Management chapter for more details) then configure the following dependency also:
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.picketlink</groupId>
    <artifactId>picketlink-idm-schema</artifactId>
    <version>${picketlink.version}</version>
  </dependency>]]></programlisting>
