      <title>What is PicketLink?</title>
      
      <para>
        PicketLink is an Application Security Framework for Java EE applications.  It provides features for authenticating users,
        authorizing access to the business methods of your application, managing your application's users, groups, roles and
        permissions, plus much more.  The following diagram presents a high level overview of the PicketLink modules and the 
        main features provided by those modules:

      <title>Where do I get started?</title>
      
      <para>
        Depending on exactly which PicketLink features you'd like to use, getting started can be as simple as adding the
        PicketLink jar libraries to your project (see <xref linkend="picketlink-overview-maven"/> below for more info)
        and writing a few lines of code.  To get started using PicketLink Identity Management to manage the users and other
        identity objects in your application, you can head straight to <xref linkend="picketlink-idm-overview-5min"/>.  If you don't
        wish to use PicketLink IDM but would like to use PicketLink for authentication in your Java EE application but control the
        authentication process yourself then head to <xref linkend="picketlink-authentication-basic"/> for simplistic example which 
        you may adapt for your own application.  If you wish to use SAML SSO then you can head to <xref linkend="picketlink-federation"/>.

        </para>
        
        <para>
          Quickstarts are self-contained, concise examples that generally demonstrate at most one or two features.  The PicketLink
          quickstarts at GitHub provide working, buildable code that shows the usage of a number of authentication and authorization
          features.

        <title>Base module</title>
        
        <para>
          The base module provides the integration framework required to use PicketLink within a Java EE application.  
          It defines a flexible authentication API that allows pluggable authentication mechanisms to be easy configured,
          with a sensible default authentication policy that delegates to the identity management subsystem. It provides
          session-scoped authentication tracking for web applications and other session-capable clients, plus a
          customisable permissions SPI that supports a flexible range of authorization mechanisms for object-level security.
          It is the "glue" that integrates all of the PicketLink modules together to provide a cohesive API, and also provides
          CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) producers to allow you to inject the PicketLink API objects directly into 
          your application's beans.https://github.com/picketlink/picketlink-quickstarts

        <title>Identity Management</title>
        
        <para>
          The Identity Management module defines the base identity model; a collection of interfaces and classes
          that represent the identity constructs (such as users, groups and roles) used throughout PicketLink (see
          the Identity Management chapter for more details).  As such, it is a required module and must always be 
          included in any application deployments that use PicketLink for security. It also provides a uniform API 
          for managing the identity objects within your application.   The Identity Management module has been designed
          with minimal dependencies and may be used in a Java SE environment, however the recommended environment is
          Java EE in conjunction with the base module.

          The Federation module is an optional module that implements a number of Federated Identity standards, 
          such as SAML (both version 1.1 and 2.0), WS-Trust and OpenID.

      <title>Maven Dependencies</title>
      
      <para>
        The PicketLink libraries are available from the Maven Central Repository.  To use PicketLink in your Maven-based
        project, it is recommended that you first define a version property for PicketLink in your project's 
        <literal>pom.xml</literal> file like so:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<properties>
  <picketlink.version>]]>&project.version;<![CDATA[</picketlink.version>
</properties>]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        For a typical application, it is suggested that you include the following PicketLink dependencies:
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<dependencies>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.picketlink</groupId>
      <artifactId>picketlink-api</artifactId>
      <scope>compile</scope>
      <version>${picketlink.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.picketlink</groupId>
      <artifactId>picketlink-impl</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
      <version>${picketlink.version}</version>
  </dependency>]]></programlisting>
  
      <para>
        The identity management library is a required dependency of the base module and so will be automatically included.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you wish to use PicketLink's Identity Management features and want to include the default database schema
        (see the Identity Management chapter for more details) then configure the following dependency also:
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.picketlink</groupId>
    <artifactId>picketlink-idm-simple-schema</artifactId>
    <version>${picketlink.version}</version>
  </dependency>]]></programlisting>
