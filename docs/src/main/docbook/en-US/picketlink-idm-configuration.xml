          Configuration in PicketLink is in essence quite simple; an <code>IdentityConfiguration</code> object must first 
          be created to hold the PicketLink configuration options.  Once all configuration options have been set, you just create a 
          <code>IdentityManagerFactory</code> instance passing the previously created configuration.            
          The <code>IdentityManagerFactory</code> can then be used to create <code>IdentityManager</code> instances 
          via the <code>createIdentityManager()</code> method.

        <para>
          The <code>IdentityConfiguration</code> is usually created using a Configuration Builder API, which provides a rich and fluent API for every single aspect of PicketLink configuration.
        </para>

        <note>
          <para>
            For now, all configuration is set programmatically using the Configuration Builder API only. Later versions will also support a declarative configuration in a form of XML documents.   
          </para>
        </note>

        <para>
          Each <code>IdentityManager</code> instance has its own <emphasis>security context</emphasis>, represented by
          the <code>SecurityContext</code> class.  The security context contains temporary state which is maintained 
          for one or more identity management operations within the scope of a single realm or tier.  The 
          <code>IdentityManager</code> (and its associated <code>SecurityContext</code>) is typically modelled as a
          request-scoped object (for environments which support such a paradigm, such as a servlet container), or alternatively
          as an actor within the scope of a transaction.  In the latter case, the underlying resources being 
          utilised by the configured identity stores (such as a JPA <code>EntityManager</code>) would participate in 
          the active transaction, and changes made as a result of any identity management operations would either be 
          committed or rolled back as appropriate for the logic of the encapsulating business method.
        </para>
            
        <para>
          The following sections describe various ways that configuration may be performed in different environments.

        <title>Programmatic Configuration</title>
      
        <para>
          Configuration for Identity Management can be defined programmatically using the Configuration Builder API. The aim of this API is to make it easier to chain coding
          of configuration options in order to speed up the coding itself and make the configuration more <emphasis>readable</emphasis>.
        </para>
        <para>        
          Let's assume that you want to quick start with PicketLink Identity Management features using a file-based Identity Store. 
          First, a fresh instance of <code>IdentityConfiguration</code> is created using the <code>IdentityConfigurationBuilder</code> helper object, 
          where we choose which identity store we want to use (in this case a file-based store) and any other configuration option, if necessary. 
          Finally, we use the configuration to create a <code>IdentityManagerFactory</code> from where we can create <code>IdentityManager</code> instances and start to perform Identity Management operations:

IdentityConfiguration configuration = builder.build();

IdentityManagerFactory identityManagerFactory = new IdentityManagerFactory(configuration);

IdentityManager identityManager = identityManagerFactory.createIdentityManager();

User user = new SimpleUser("john");

identityManager.add(user);]]></programlisting>

          <title>IdentityConfigurationBuilder for Programmatic Configuration</title>

          <para>
            The <code>IdentityConfigurationBuilder</code> is the entry point for PicketLink configuration. 
            It is a very simple class with some meaningful methods for all supported configuration options.
          </para>

        <para>
          The <code>SecurityContext</code> plays an important role in the PicketLink IDM achitecture. As discussed in the <link linkend='idm_architecture_overview'>Architectural Overview</link>, 
          it is strongly used during the execution of operations. It carries very sensitive and contextual information for a specific operation and provides access for some of the 
          IDM underlying services such as caching, event handling, UUID generator for <code>IdentityTpe</code> and <code>Relationship</code> instances, among others.

          <para>
          	Sometimes you may need to provide additional configuration or even references for external resources before the operation is executed by an identity store.
          	An example is how you tell to the<code>JPAIdentityStore</code> which <code>EntityManager</code> instance should be used. 
        	  When executing an operation, the <code>JPAIdentityStore</code> must be able to access the current <code>EntityManager</code> to persist or retrieve data from the database.
        	  You need someway to populate the <code>SecurityContext</code> with such information. When you're configuring an identity store, there is a configuration option
        	  that allows you to provide a <code>ContextInitializer</code> implementation.

				  <para>
				  	The method <code>initContextForStore</code> will be invoked for every single operation and before its execution by the identity store. 
			  		It can be implemented to provide all the necessary logic to initialize and populate the <code>SecurityContext</code> for a specific <code>IdentityStore</code>.

					  <para>
						  Remember that initializers are executed for every single operation. 
						  Also, the same instance is used between operations which means your implementation should be <quote>stateless</quote>.

        <title>Identity Store Feature Set</title>
      
        <para>
          When configuring identity stores you must tell which features and operations should be executed by them. Features and operations are a key concept if you want to mix stores in order to execute
          operations against different repositories.
        </para>
        <para>
        	PicketLink provides a Java <code>enum</code>, called <code>FeatureGroup</code>, in which are defined all supported features. The table bellow summarize them:

        <para>
        	The features are a determinant factor when choosing an identity store to execute a specific operation. For example, if an identity store is configured with <code>FeatureGroup.user</code> we're saying
        	that all <code>User</code> operations should be executed by this identity store. The same goes for <code>FeatureGroup.credential</code>, we're just saying that credentials can also be updated and validated using 
        	the identity store.
        </para>
        <para>
        	Beside that, provide only the feature is not enough. We must also tell the identity store which operations are supported by a feature. For example, we can configure a identity store to support only
        	read operations for users, which is very common when using the LDAP identity store against a read-only tree. Operations are also defined by an <code>enum</code>, called <code>FeatureOperation</code>, as follows:
